## Asthma Prediction Project

## Description

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting asthma. The project utilizes various data augmentation, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict asthma based on input data.

## Features

- Data augmentation in feature space on tabular data scripts to enhance the dataset for better model training.
- Data preprocessing for cleaning and preparing the dataset for model ingestion.
- Implementation of various machine learning models for the prediction of asthma.
